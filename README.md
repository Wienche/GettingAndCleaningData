## README

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The result of the project is stored in https://github.com/Wienche/GettingAndCleaningData

In this repository the following files can be found: 

1) a tidy data set that contains (processed) data that was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
3) a readme file README.md that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Ad 1) A tidy dataset 

In the tidy dataset called "tbl_TidyData2.txt", the test and training datasets are merged into a single dataset. Morover, descriptive activitynaems and descriptive variable names are added. The file contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (combination of respondent and activity). Moreover, the data are sorted on subjectID and activityId. 

## Ad 2) The codebook 

The code book called "CodeBook.md" describes the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data. 

## Ad 3) The Readme file

The readme file, called "README.md" (this file) explains what can be found in the repository. Q.E.D.
